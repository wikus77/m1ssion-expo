# Test Scripts for package.json

Since we can't directly modify package.json, here are the test scripts that should be added to run the Playwright tests:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "playwright test",
  "test:ui": "playwright test --ui",
  "test:chrome": "playwright test --project=chromium",
  "test:firefox": "playwright test --project=firefox",
  "test:safari": "playwright test --project=webkit",
  "test:mobile": "playwright test --project=mobile-chrome --project=mobile-safari",
  "test:tablet": "playwright test --project=tablet-chrome --project=tablet-safari",
  "test:debug": "playwright test --debug",
  "test:report": "playwright show-report"
}
```

To add these scripts, you'll need to manually update your package.json or use the Lovable interface to add these commands.
